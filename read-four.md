 **What is script?**

 *A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.*

*Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.* 

 

  ## In this read4, we are focussing on the JavaScript language and how it is used in web browsers.*

### Just like learning any new language, you need to get to grips with the: 

1. Vocabulary: The words that computers
understand

2. Syntax: How you put those words together to
create instructions computers can follow
  


  ### An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions:

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE:

`var color = 'beige'; `

 **The value of co 1 or is now beige.**

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE :

`var area = 3 * 2;`
 
 **The value of area is now 6.**

  ### Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values:


1. `greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';`
  **The value of greeting is now Hi Molly.**

2. `buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); `
  **The value of buy is now true.**  


### JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers:


 1. ADDITION  `+`   Adds one value to another  `10 + 5`  ` 15 `
 2. SUBTRACTION `-`  Subtracts one value from another  `10 - 5`   `5`
 3. DIVISION   `/`   Divides two values    `10 /  5 `  `2`
 4. MULTIPLICATION  `*`  Multiplies two values using an asterisk (Note that this is not the letter x)  `10 * 5`  `50`
 5. INCREMENT   `+ +`   Adds one to the current number   `i = 10; i++;`   `11` 
 6. DECREMENT   `- -`   Subtracts one from the current number `i = 10; i--;`   `9` 
 7. MODULUS     `%`     Divides two values and returns the remainder  `10 % 3`  `1` 


# Examples on javascript:
  1. `var subtotal (13 + 1) * 5;` // Subtotal is `70`
     `var shipping 0.5 * (13 + 1) ;` // Shipping is `7` 
 
`var total subtotal + shipping ;` // Total is `77`

  2. `var number = 12;`
   `var street= 'Ivy Road';`
   `var add = number + street;`  //  You would end up with a string saying `'12Ivy Road'` .
