You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.*

### You can write text in several ways such as:
* bold text use ** ** .
* Text in deferent size use (# ).
* Emphasis text use star before and after text.

### List have many shaps:
#### Sometimes you want numbered lists:
1. But number 1 and point in each one.

#### Sometimes you want bullet points:
* But star in each one.


### To add image:
* But ![]() in the brackets input the image name and in the Parentheses input the link of image.


### To write link:
* But []() brackets for link name and Parentheses for link of a page.


### Task Lists:
* write - then x inside [] to show that:

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item


### table:
* You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |
such as:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
