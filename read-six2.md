## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

**Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).**


To create a function you give it name and then write the statments needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.
 Example:
`function sayHello(){`
`document.write('hello');`
`}`

`function` its Function keyword
`sayHello()` its function name 
`document.write('hello');` its code block (in curly braces)
